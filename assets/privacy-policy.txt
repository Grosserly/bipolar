TL;DR: In order to imitate you, Parrot stores your messages. If you ever want to, you can always make Parrot stop doing that or see and delete what it has collected.

Parrot's main functionality is to imitate users. To do this, Parrot collects and stores the text contents of the messages you send in select channels. When Parrot receives a command to imitate you, your stored messages are processed through an algorithm made to generate new sentences that sound like you. The text content of the messages Parrot collects are kept by Parrot's owner, <@206235904644349953>, indefinitely. <@206235904644349953> reserves the right to erase part or all of your stored data at any time if it is found to be in violation of Discord's ToS, /r/Ooer's rules, and/or the law of the country the data is stored in.

When you register your Discord user ID with Parrot, Parrot will begin to collect all the messages you send from that point on in /r/Ooer #general until you decide to unregister. Parrot stores the following parts of each message:
- text (including mentions, emojis, and URLs to sites, images, and videos)
- time and date the message was posted
- your Discord user ID

You, at any time, have the right to:
1) download a copy of your data.
2) delete your data.
3) remove your registration from Parrot. Note that unregistering does not automatically delete your data.

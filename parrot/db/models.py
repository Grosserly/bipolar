"""
Parrot's database models, using SQLModel.

This is essentially a local cache of data from the Discord API that Parrot
relies on, plus some of Parrot's own information.

N.B. The primary keys on tables that are direct analogs to Discord entities
(e.g., Channel, Message) are intentionally _not_ created automatically by the
database, and are expected to be the same as their IDs from Discord.
Primary keys of Parrot-proprietary tables are autoincremented.
"""

# TODO: with markovify.Text.combine(), is regenerating necessary anymore, except
# for infrequent things like message edits and deletes? Can models instead be
# kept (serialized or pickled) always and only in the database?

# TODO: understand .commit() and .refresh()/see if there are any occurrences of
# them that can be deleted
